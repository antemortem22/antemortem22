## 👩‍💻 Who I Am

I’m a backend-oriented developer who enjoys building structured systems, understanding how things work under the hood, and designing software with intention.

I love:

- 🧠 Breaking down complex problems  
- 🏗 Thinking in architecture before code  
- 🔍 Learning new technologies just to understand how they’re built  
- ⚙️ Turning ideas into scalable systems  

Curiosity drives me. Autonomy shapes me. Creativity balances me.

## 🏗 Current Focus

Building a production-minded portfolio structured with:

- Clean separation of responsibilities

This is not just a portfolio.  
It’s a systems-thinking exercise.

I don’t code just to make things work.  
I design so they can grow.

I care about:
- Clarity
- Structure
- Maintainability
- Intentional decisions
